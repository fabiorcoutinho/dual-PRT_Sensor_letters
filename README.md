# dual-PRT_Sensor_letters
Matlab script created for the article "A fast and improved dual-PRT Doppler technique for industrial flow metering", IEEE Sensor Letters
The script needs as input a .mat file acquired from a NI PXI system
It outputs the spatialtemporal velocity map and a spatial velocity profile
Please refer to the paper/script comments for more details
