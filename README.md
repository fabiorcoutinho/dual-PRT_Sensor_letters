# dual-PRT_Sensor_letters
Matlab script created for the article "A fast and improved dual-PRT Doppler technique for industrial flow metering", IEEE Sensor Letters
The script needs as input a .mat file acquired from a NI PXI system (example archive - link below)
It outputs the spatialtemporal velocity map and a spatial velocity profile
Please refer to the paper/script comments for more details
Main File: ProcessSensorLettersLivePXI.mlx
Matlab R2021 or later
To test the code use the example file available at (large file ~700Mb)
